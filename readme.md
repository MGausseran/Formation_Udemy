# Formation Udemy - JavaScript Projects

This repository is dedicated to hosting the projects related to the JavaScript course I'm currently following on Udemy. It's an additional course that Iâ€™m taking to further improve my skills alongside my main training at BeCode Brussels.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to document my progress and showcase various small projects that I'll be working on as part of this supplementary learning journey. Each project will reflect new concepts and techniques learned from the course. More projects will be added as I continue my learning!

## :hammer: Work in progress :hammer:

Several small projects are coming soon, so stay tuned for updates and improvements!
